See <a href="http://frontlineclub.com/awards"> the Frontline Club Awards page</a> for an example of it in action.

This makes use of the <a href="https://jlord.github.io/sheetsee.js/">Sheetsee.js</a> project, which provides a client-side library for visualising data in a Google Spreadsheet.

See functions.php for a sample of how to insert the needed HTML markup in a wordpress theme, by using a shortcode.
